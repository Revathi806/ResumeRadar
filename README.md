The AI-powered resume screening system presents an innovative and intelligent solution for
automating the initial stages of the recruitment process. Traditionally, Human Resource (HR)
professionals are required to manually review a substantial volume of resumes—a practice that
is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to subjective bias and potential oversight of
qualified candidates. To address these inefficiencies, the proposed system harnesses the
capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to intelligently
evaluate resumes against role-specific job descriptions (JDs).
Through ML, the system is trained to identify and extract critical data from resumes—such as
technical skills, work experience, educational qualifications, and certifications—and match
them with predefined requirements outlined by HR personnel. NLP enhances this process by
performing semantic analysis, ensuring that the evaluation goes beyond simple keyword
matching and instead captures the context and relevance of each candidate's experience.
A prominent feature of this system is its support for bulk resume uploads, enabling hundreds
of applications to be processed simultaneously. Each resume is assigned a dynamic relevance
score, allowing HR professionals to efficiently categorize candidates into groups such as
“Selected for Round 2” or “Rejected.” Notably, the scoring model evolves continuously
through feedback loops, adapting over time based on HR input to improve decision-making
accuracy.
In addition to streamlining HR workflows, the platform offers a dedicated Candidate Portal,
where job seekers can upload their resumes and receive instant, AI-generated feedback. This
includes a relevance score accompanied by personalized suggestions for enhancement,
empowering candidates to align their profiles more closely with market expectations.
By blending artificial intelligence with human expertise, the platform aspires to enhance
recruitment efficiency, consistency, and fairness, thereby revolutionizing modern hiring
practices
